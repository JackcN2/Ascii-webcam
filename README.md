# Ascii-webcam

This program functions as a  (non-practical) video confrencing program with a unique twist. Video is displayed through text and ascii characters instead of images, meaning the program can run completely in the command line. As there is no way to transmit audio directly over text the program detects user speech and displays it as text.




Make sure that the two scripts stay in the same directory as they both need to refrence one of the same files for operation. 







There is both a windows and linux version avalible.  They  are cross-platform, but the linux version does not suppourt speech detection
